# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer: A statement that checks if a condition is true and returning a result based on the outcome of the condition. So if I want to compare two items, I can use a conitional to see if one is greater than the other and provide an output accordingly.

Researched answer: Conditionals are if else statements that allow us to evaluate a particular condition and provide a specific output accordingly.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?


(Lyssa)
Your answer: Git is a version control software developed in the early 200s that tracks changes to code on a local device (personal computer). GitHub is a cloud-based website that uses Git, and makes it connect to other servers/computers via the internet.
Researched answer: WHile Git is a version control system that allows a user to keep track of source code history, GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you host Git repositories (databases) outside of a local device via the internet.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?
(Matthew)
Your answer: ==, ===, &&, !&&, true, false, will all return a Boolean value in the terminal.
Researched answer: Relational operators like greater than >, less than <, greater than or equal to >=, less than or equal to <=. Loose == and Strict === equality operators, the logical operators like and &&, or ||, and not !. These will all return a Boolean value for the called upon line of code.

(Nate)
Your answer: Three logical operators will return a Boolean value, AND, OR, and NOT. AND operators return a statement that works if both statements are true, OR only requires one statement to be true, while NOT statements return the opposite of AND statements.
Researched answer: There are three logical operators that return a Boolean value; AND, OR, and NOT. AND operators are represented by two ampersands (&&) and requires both arguments to be true to return a true statement, if one is true and one is false it will return false. OR operators are represented by two vertical line symbols (||) and require only one argument to be true to return a true statement, if one is true and one is false it will return true, as there is one true and it only needs one. NOT operators represented by an exclamation point (!) will return the inverse of the argument, if the argument is true, NOT will return false, and vice versa.

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?
(Goran)
Your answer: Index refers to position/location of an element in an array, or a string. Value refers to the information/data in a specific location.
It is like an address where somebody lives. The address will be in order and never change, while people living there (values) can change.
Researched answer: Index is READ-ONLY property and it starts with 0. The value is the information stored in an element.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings.
(Jeremy)

Your answer: Arrays and Strings Compared:

Arrays and strings are both primitives
They both can use bracket notation
They both have built in methods
They both can utilize an index
They both can hold a value
They can both be declared with var, const, and let
You can loop through an array and a string

Arrays and Strings Contrasted:

Strings store string data only
Arrays can store strings, arrays, objects, integers, booleans, and floats
Strings cannot change the value with bracket notation
Arrays can change value with bracket notation
Researched answer: According to: http://www.differencebetween.net/technology/difference-between-array-and-string/, The main difference between arrays and strings is that arrays can have any data type of any length while strings are ASCII characters. It goes on to say that a string is a sequence of characters that is represented as a single data item, and that an array is a sequenced collection of elements.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?
(Tawn)

Your answer: Proper pair programming consist of a driver(s), person who types out the code and the navigator, the person who steers the direction of the coding process.
good proper pair programming is communicating clearly the problem and objective of the solution and both figuring out how to do so using the available tools such as Github, Zoom and Slack. This way multiple people are working on the project and are able to cross check and validate each other.
Researched answer:
Pair programming is a software development technique that splits the workload of a project into multpile roles. These roles usually conside of a driver, the person who will be responsible for writing the code, and the navigator, the person who will be responsible for checking the code and giving instructions and guidance, considering the future direction and the strategies of the project.

(David)
Your answer: Pair programming consists of collaboration between 2 or more people. They work together on the same project. The will alternate sharing their screen with the other person while they work. The person sharing the screen is known as the driver. The driver allows the other person, known as the navigator, to tell them what to code. While alternating back and forth there is ongoing communication about the project and they work together to solve any problems.

Researched answer: Everybody has different skills so we work together to help each other out. Working together has many benefits such as holding each other accountable and making less errors. The roles of pair programming are known as driver and navigator. The driver shares the screen and allows the navigator to lead the way. They alternate being driver and navigator approximately every 10-20 minutes.
